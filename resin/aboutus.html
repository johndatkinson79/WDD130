            <p>Hi there! I’m Nicky and I’m the founder of T&A Emporium. Producing gifts from resin has been a passion and hobby of mine for many many years and I’m excited to use that passion for you. </p>

            <p>y business started shortly after I got married and one of my husbands’ friends was really amazed by the unique wedding favour, we gave our guests. He asked me to make something similar for him for his wedding and I agreed. From that wedding came another other order for a cheeseboard, then an order for a gift for a grandchild, then BOOM. Suddenly my inbox was being flooded with requests for gifts, wedding favours and memorabilia.</p>

            <p>I started to run a small market stall in my local town in Lancashire, and then the COVID pandemic swept the UK, and the full lockdown came into force. Lockdown meant I could no longer trade so my market stall stopped however, the orders and requests for resin products did not! COVID gave me the opportunity to put my business online and reach a wider audience. I am lucky to be able to say the business has grown from strength to strength since.</p>
