    <p>Hello everyone I am excited to get to know you all as we complete this course together!</p>
    <p>I am originally from a small town near London in the UK, but I have lived all over the UK and currently 
        reside in Chorley a market town near Preston. I have been married to my wonderful wife, Nichola, for four
        years and we have a very spoilt Border Collie called Roxy. My interests include reading, watching movies and I am 
        a very keen gamer and often get competitive with my wife!</p>
    <p>I am a Data Analyst for the National Health Service which is a very busy and demanding job. I am very lucky to be able
        to say that I have a job that I really do enjoy. This is my very first class for me degree at BYU and I am a bit nervous
        but so glad that I have made the decision to pursue a new degree. I first completed university over 20 years ago but love
        learning new skills and subjects and wanted to pursue another degree.</p>
        <p>I am a convert to the church and have been a member of the church for about six years now. Getting baptized has probably been
           the best decision I ever made because, without the church I wouldn't have met my amazing wife! My favourite quote is one that
           was shared with me whilst I was investigating. Its from Jeffery R Holland and says "Don't you quit. You keep walking. You keep
           trying. There is hope and happiness ahead." I love it because it reminds me that when things are tough, the future is still bright.</p>
